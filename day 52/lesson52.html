                <p><strong>Red wine is a type of wine made from dark-colored grape varieties. The color of the wine can range from intense violet,<br> typical of young wines, through to brick red for mature wines and brown for older red wines. The juice from most purple<br> grapes is greenish-white, the red color coming from anthocyan pigments present in the skin of the grape. Much of the red<br> wine production process involves extraction of color and flavor components from the grape skin.Some winemakers prefer<br> to chill the must to around 10 °C (50 °F), to allow a period of pre-fermentation maceration ("cold soaking"), of between<br> one and four days. The idea is that color and fruit flavours are extracted into the aqueous solution, without extraction of<br> tannins which takes place in post-fermentation maceration when alcohol is present. This practice is by no means universal<br> and is perhaps more common in New World winemaking countries.</strong></p>

                <p><strong>White wine is a wine that is fermented without skin contact. The colour can be straw-yellow, yellow-green, or yellow-gold.<br> It is produced by the alcoholic fermentation of the non-coloured pulp of grapes, which may have a skin of any colour. White<br> wine has existed for at least 4,000 years.The wide variety of white wines comes from the large number of varieties, methods<br> of winemaking, and ratios of residual sugar. White wine is mainly from "white" grapes, which are green or yellow in colour,<br> such as the Chardonnay, Sauvignon blanc and Riesling. Some white wine is also made from grapes with coloured skin, provided<br> that the obtained wort is not stained. Pinot noir, for example, is commonly used to produce champagne.</strong></p>

            <p><strong>Wine is an alcoholic drink made from fermented fruit. Yeast consumes the sugar in the fruit and converts it to<br> ethanol and carbon dioxide,releasing heat in the process. Wine is most often made from grapes, and the term<br> "wine" generally refers to grape wine when used without any qualification. Even so, wine can be made from a<br> variety of fruit crops, including plum, cherry, pomegranate, blueberry, currant, and elderberry.Different<br> varieties of grapes and strains of yeasts are major factors in different styles of wine. These differences result<br> from the complex interactions between the biochemical development of the grape, the reactions involved in<br> fermentation, the grape's growing environment (terroir), and the wine production process. Many countries enact<br> legal appellations intended to define styles and qualities of wine. These typically restrict the geographical origin<br> and permitted varieties of grapes, as well as other aspects of wine production.</strong></p>
