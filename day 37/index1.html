        <div> <p><i>Holland appeared in four episodes of BBC Two's historical miniseries Wolf Hall (2015), as Gregory Cromwell,<br> son of the protagonist Thomas Cromwell played by Mark Rylance. He directed Tweet (2015), a 3-minute short film<br> about a young man building a birdhouse with his grandfather; Holland later expressed an interest in directing <br>feature films in his 40s. Also in 2015, Holland co-starred as the teenage sailor Thomas Nickerson<br> in Ron Howard's historical adventure-drama In the Heart of the Sea. The film is based on the<br> namesake 2000 non-fiction book about the sinking of the American whaling ship Essex in 1820. In preparation, he<br> and co-stars, including Chris Hemsworth, lost significant weight, consuming 50-1,000 calories a day. Holland performed<br> most of his stunts in the film. In the Heart of the Sea received mixed reviews from critics, and grossed $93 million against<br> a $100 million budget. Brian Truitt of the USA Today wrote that Holland "does a good job".</i></p>
