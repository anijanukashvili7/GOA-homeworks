            <p><strong>CSS Animations is a module of Cascading Style Sheets. It allows users to hover over objects and an animation will play.<br> Currently, it is adopted by all major search engines. Despite the controversy from those who prefer animation via Javascript,<br> the hover tag is now widely used across the Cascading Style Sheets community.</strong></p>

            <p><strong>While the pseudo-class :hover has been used to generate rudimentary animations for years, extensions of CSS into the realm of animation<br> were minimal until the late 2000s decade. As early as 2007, WebKit had announced its intent to include CSS animation, transitions, and<br> transforms as features of WebKit. It also announced the implementation of both implicit and explicit animation through CSS in February<br> 2009. CSS animation has also been put forth as a feature of CSS3, the ongoing draft specification managed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).</strong></p>
