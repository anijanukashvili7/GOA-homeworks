    <h1><strong>Battle of Krtsanisi</strong></h1>

    <!--information-->


    <p><i>The Battle of Krtsanisi (Georgian: კრწანისის ბრძოლა, romanized: k'rts'anisis brdzola, Persian: نبرد کرتسانیسی) <br>was fought between the army of Qajar Iran<br> (Persia) and the Georgian armies of the Kingdom of Kartli-Kakheti and Kingdom of Imereti<br> at the place of Krtsanisi near Tbilisi,<br> Georgia, from September 8 to September 11, 1795, as part of Agha Mohammad Khan<br> Qajar's war in response to King Heraclius II of Georgia’s alliance with the Russian Empire.<br> The battle resulted in the decisive defeat of the Georgians, capture, and complete<br> destruction of their capital Tbilisi,[1 as well as the temporary absorption<br> of eastern parts of Georgia into the Iranian empire.</i></p>

    <p><i>Although the Russian Empire had officially declared in the Treaty of Georgievsk of<br> 1783 that it would protect Heraclius's kingdom against any new Iranian attempts<br> to re-subjugate Georgia, Russia did not intervene to protect its ally.</i></p>

    <h2><strong>Background</strong></h2>

    <!--information-->

    <p><i>Eastern Georgia, composed of the kingdoms of Kartli and Kakheti, had been in the early <br>modern era under Iranian suzerainty since the 1510s.<br> In 1744, Nader Shah had granted the kingship of Kartli and Kakheti to Teimuraz II and his <br>son Heraclius II respectively, as a reward for their loyalty.<br> When Nader Shah died in 1747, they capitalized on the chaos that had erupted in<br> mainland Iran, and declared de facto independence. After Teimuraz II died in 1762,<br> Heraclius II assumed control over Kartli, and united the two<br> kingdoms in a personal union as the Kingdom of Kartli-Kakheti, becoming the first Georgian ruler to preside over a politically<br> unified eastern Georgia in three centuries.<br> At about the same time, Karim Khan Zand had ascended the<br> Iranian throne; Heraclius II quickly tendered his de jure submission to the new Iranian ruler, however,<br> de facto, he remained autonomous.<br> In 1783, Heraclius placed his kingdom under the protection of the Russian Empire in the Treaty of Georgievsk.</i></p>

    <p><i>In the last few decades of the 18th century, Georgia had become a more important element <br>in Russo-Iranian relations than some provinces in northern mainland Persia, such as Mazandaran or even Gilan. Unlike Peter I, Catherine, the then<br> ruling monarch of Russia, viewed Georgia as a pivot for her Caucasian policy, as Russia's new aspirations were to use it as a base of operations<br> against both Iran and the Ottoman Empire, both immediate bordering geo-political rivals of Russia.</i></p>

    <h3><strong>Battle</strong></h3>

    <!--information-->

    <p><i>In August 1795, Agha Mohammad Khan crossed the Aras river with a 70,000-strong army.<br> This force was divided in three: the left wing was sent in the direction of Erivan, the right one parallel to the Caspian Sea into<br> the Mughan across the lower Aras towards Dagestan and Shirvan, while the Shah headed the centre force himself,<br> advancing towards the fortress of Shusha in the Karabakh Khanate, which he besieged between 8 July and 9 August 1795.</i></p>

    <p><i>His right and left wing forced the Khans of Ganja and Erivan into alliance respectively.<br> Having abandoned the siege of Shusha due to stiff resistance, which was further aided by Georgian crown prince Aleksandre,<br> the Khan of Karabakh, Ibrahim Khan, eventually surrendered to Mohammad Khan after discussions, including the paying of regular tribute and <br>to surrender hostages, though the Qajar forces were still denied entrance to Shusha.</i></p>
