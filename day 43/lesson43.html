                <p><i>Medical massage is outcome-based massage, primarily the application of a specific treatment targeted to the specific problem<br> the patient presents with a diagnosis and are administered after a thorough assessment/evaluation by the medical massage<br> therapist with specific outcomes being the basis for treatment. It is also known as clinical massage or treatment massage.<br>There are many massage schools and programs that teach medical massage as a technique. Though medical massage is any<br> massage treatment used to treat specific medical conditions, there is no one technique that is medical massage (literary review).<br> Medical massage is taking whatever style of massage the practitioner knows and applying that technique to specific conditions<br> to bring about specific outcomes.</i></p>

                <p class="bor"><i>Any Licensed Massaged Therapist is qualified to do medical massage if they have training on how<br> to treat specific problems. State Licensure is the only qualification needed to bill for massage therapy.<br> In Washington State and many other states part of the state licensure includes some treatment massage <br>training but the amount of training varies greatly. Massage customers should ask, Therapist about their<br> training and experience in treating the specific conditions that they have. Washington State and Florida<br> are currently the only states that mandates that Massage Therapists be allowed to be contracted providers<br> with health insurance companies. Currently, the Affordable Healthcare Act of 2010 does make provisions<br> for every type of provider to be covered in insurance plans. It is possible that massage will be covered<br> by insurance under this new Act.</i></p>

            <h3>History</h3>
            <section id="hi">
                <div>
                <p><i>Massage has been used as a medical treatment dating back to the Chinese over 5000 years ago.<br> More recently Professor Silas Weir Mitchell (1829-1914), a neurologist in Philadelphia is<br> thought to be the first to bring massage to the attention of the US medical community. In 1884,<br> Douglas Graham, MD of Boston Massachusetts wrote A Practical Treatise on Massage which<br> focuses on the treatment of specific diseases and disorders by using massage as a treatment. In 1885,<br> Harvey Kellogg published the classic textbook The Art of Massage, Its Physiological Effects and<br> Therapeutic Actions. During the nineteenth century, massage in Europe was described in the medical<br> literature and was taught at institutions and also offered by lay practitioners. In 1886, William Murrell,<br> an English Physician wrote a book Massage as a Mode of Treatment. In Russia, M.Y. Mudrov, MD used<br> massage and movement exercises in his medical practice with adults and later applied it to the development of children.</i></p>
