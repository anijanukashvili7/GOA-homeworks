<p>Python Data types are the classification or categorization of data items. It represents the kind of value that tells what operations can be performed on a particular data. Since everything is an object in Python programming, Python data types are classes and variables are instances (objects) of these classes.</p>


<p>To define the values ​​of various data types of Python and check their data types we use the type() function. Consider the following examples.

    This code assigns variable ‘x’ different values of various Python data types. It covers string, integer, float, complex, list, tuple, range, dictionary, set, frozenset, boolean, bytes, bytearray, memoryview, and the special value ‘None’ successively. Each assignment replaces the previous value, making ‘x’ take on the data type and value of the most recent assignment.</p>
