<h2>HISTORY</h2>

<p>The business was established in 1947 by Erling Persson when he opened his first shop in Västerås, Sweden. The shop was called Hennes (Swedish for 'hers') and only sold women's clothing. Another store opened in Norway in 1964.[16] In 1968, Persson acquired the hunting apparel retailer Mauritz Widforss in Stockholm, which led to the inclusion of a menswear collection in the product range, and the name was changed to Hennes & Mauritz.</p>


<p>The company was listed on the Stockholm Stock Exchange in 1974.[15] Shortly after, in 1976, the first store outside Scandinavia opened in London.[15][17] H&M continued to expand in Europe and began to retail online in 1998[18] with the domain hm.com, which was registered in 1997 according to data available via WHOIS. The opening of its first U.S. store on 31 March 2000 on Fifth Avenue in New York City marked the start of its expansion outside of Europe</p>
