        <div>
            <p><strong>Miley Cyrus, born Destiny Hope Cyrus on November 23, 1992, in Franklin, Tennessee, has carved a distinctive niche in the entertainment industry.<br> Daughter of country singer Billy Ray Cyrus, her journey began with an early exposure to music and acting, which became the foundation for her <br>soaring career. Known for her versatile talent, Miley transitioned from being a Disney star to a global pop sensation, all while making headlines with<br> her bold personality and unapologetic stance on various societal issues. Cyrus's career kick-started in 2004, when she beat out a thousand hopefuls to<br> land the leading role of Miley Stewart/Hannah Montana in the Disney Channel series Hannah Montana. The show, which aired from 2006 to 2011,<br> catapulted her to fame, and she quickly became a teen idol. Her success as Hannah Montana led to a series of soundtrack albums, concert tours, and<br> merchandise, solidifying her status as a Disney sensation. However, it was her decision to step away from her wholesome image that marked a significant<br> turning point in her career. In 2008, Cyrus released her first non-Hannah Montana album, Breakout, which paved the way for her transition into a<br> more mature sound.</strong></p>
