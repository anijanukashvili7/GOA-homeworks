<h1>Battle of Didgori</h1>

<!--Information-->

<div>
    <p>The Battle of Didgori (Georgian: დიდგორის ბრძოლა, romanized: <br> didgoris brdzola) was fought between the armies of the Kingdom of Georgia and the Seljuk <br> Empire at the narrow place of Didgori, 40 km west of Tbilisi, on August 12, 1121. <br> The large Muslim army, under the command of Ilghazi, was unable to maneuver and suffered <br> a devastating defeat due to King David IV of Georgia's effective military tactics.</p>

The battle at Didgori was the culmination of the entire Georgian-Seljuk wars and led to the Georgians' <br> reconquest of Tbilisi in 1122. Soon after that David moved the capital from Kutaisi to Tbilisi. <br> The victory at Didgori inaugurated the medieval Georgian Golden Age and is celebrated <br> in The Georgian Chronicles as a (Georgian: ძლევაჲ საკვირველი dzlevay sak'virveli lit. <br> the "miraculous victory"). Modern Georgians continue to remember the event as an annual August 12 <br> festival known as Didgoroba ("[the day] of Didgori").
