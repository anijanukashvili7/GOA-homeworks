        <h1><i><strong>Joker (playing card)</strong></i></h1>

        <!--my opinion about this game-->

        <p><i>in my opinion this game is very interesting and developmental.This game requires both thinking and the ability to calculate in advance and it is not so easy. This is my opinion and I think that this is not just a game.</i></p>

        <!--some information about joker-->

        <div><p><strong>The Joker is a playing card found in most modern French-suited card decks,<br> as an addition to the standard four suits (Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts, and Spades).<br> Since the second half, of the 20th century, they have also been found in<br> Spanish- and Italian-suited decks, excluding stripped decks.

            The Joker originated<br> in the United States during the Civil War, and was created as a trump card <br> for the game of Euchre. It has since been adopted into many other card games,<br> where it often acts as a wild card, but may have other functions such as the top trump,<br> a skip card (forcing another player to miss a turn),<br> the lowest-ranking card, the highest-value card, or a card of a different value from<br> the rest of the pack (see e.g. Zwicker which<br> has six Jokers with this function).
            
            By contrast, a wild card is any card that may be used to<br> represent another card or cards - it does not need be a Joker.</p>

        <h2><i><strong>Use of the Joker in card games</strong></i></h2>
        <div><P><strong>In a standard deck in the US or Britain, there are usually two Jokers.<br> In other countries, such as Germany, there are usually three Jokers in a pack. The Joker's use varies greatly.<br> Many card games omit the cards entirely; as a result, Jokers are sometimes used as informal replacements for lost or damaged cards in<br> a deck by simply noting the lost card's rank and suit on the Joker. Other games, such as a 25-card variant of Euchre which uses the Joker as the highest trump, make it one of the most important in the game. Often, the Joker is a wild card, which allows it to represent other existing cards. The term "Joker's wild" originates from this practice. However, in Zwicker Jokers are higher value, matching and scoring cards while, in one variant, a normal suit card is the only one that is wild.<br> The Joker can be a very beneficial card or a bad card to have. In Euchre it is often used to represent the highest trump. In Gin Rummy it is wild. However, in the children's game of Old Maid, a solitary Joker represents the Old Maid, the card to be avoided.</P>

            <li><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poker">Poker: A Joker can be wild, or can be a "bug", a limited form of wild card which can be used only to complete straights and flushes.</a></li>

            <li><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(card_game)">Pitch: A point card in some variations. Jokers usually are marked as "high" and "low", one outranking the other.</a></li>

When playing with three or six players, they are added to make the cards deal evenly (eighteen or nine cards each, respectively). They are either "junk" cards playable any time that cannot win a trick, or they count as the two highest trumps (the two Jokers must be differentiable; the "big Joker" outranks the "little Joker"). They also can be used in conjunction with teammates' cards to create a "pseudo-trump", e.g. an Ace of Hearts and a Joker played together could be counted as an Ace of Spades, inferior only to a natural Ace of Spades.</a></li>
            <li><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedro_(card_game)">Double King Pede: As the lowest-ranked card, but worth 18 points.</a></li>

            <li><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dou_dizhu">Dou dizhu: Jokers are used as the highest value cards; one is little and one is big, usually the colored one being bigger. Both Jokers together is the only unbeatable play.</a></li>

        <p>A playing card is a piece of specially prepared card stock, heavy paper, thin cardboard, plastic-coated paper, cotton-paper blend, or thin plastic that is marked with distinguishing motifs. Often the front (face) and back of each card has a finish to make handling easier. They are most commonly used for playing card games, and are also used in magic tricks, cardistry, card throwing, and card houses; cards may also be collected. Playing cards are typically palm-sized for convenient handling, and usually are sold together in a set as a deck of cards or pack of cards.The most common type of playing card in the West is the French-suited, standard 52-card pack, of which the most widespread design is the English pattern, followed by<br> the Belgian-Genoese pattern. However, many countries use other, traditional types<br> of playing card, including those that are German, Italian, Spanish and Swiss-suited.</p>
